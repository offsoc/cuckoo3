# Configuring Cuckoo3

!!! warning "Incomplete"

    Not all configurations are yet documented.  
    We are reviewing all configurations and adding more as we go.

Cuckoo configurations can be found in `~/.cuckoocwd/` directory by default.  
It holds all Cuckoo-related configuration files, and these are the broad categories:


- **conf**: holds Cuckoo and Cuckoo module configurations
    - **machineries**: virtual machines configurations
    - **node**: distributed configurations
    - **processing**: all analysis configurations(Virustotal, MISP, etc.)
    - **web**: Django configurations
- **elasticsearch**: Elasticsearch configurations
- **log**: Cuckoo logs
- **monitor**: monitor, stager and other tools for analyses
- **operational**: information about nodes, taskque database, and UNIX sockets
- **rooter**: scripts such as openvpn routes
- **safelist**: safelist database
- **signatures**: Cuckoo signatures
- **storage**: all generated assets related to analyses, such as images, pcap files, etc.
- **web**: API and web related configurations

## Cuckoo configurations

### cuckoo.yaml
Location: `conf/cuckoo.yaml`

Here we will point out the main ones that might require your attention.

- `machineries` -  this is a list of all machinery modules that Cuckoo will be using. By default, this should be `qemu`
    
- `resultserver` - resultserver must be in the same network as the analysis machines for them to communicate. In the case of our virtual machines we created that are in subnet `192.168.30.1/24`, the configuration would look like this:

- `tcpdump` - make sure this is enabled and pointing to `tcpdump` binary.

```yaml
# A YAML list of all machinery modules that should be enabled and Cuckoo will be using. Machines for
# each of the modules specified here have to be configured in their respective configuration file
# in the conf/machineries directory. It is only possible to run multiple machinery modules if their underlying
# virtualization layers do not interfere with each other.
# Example:
#
# machineries:
#   - machinery1
#   - machinery2
machineries:
  - qemu

# The resultserver is a Cuckoo component that running analysis machines upload their results to
# it should be reachable from the analysis machine. A resultserver will be started on the configured
# listen IP and port. Make sure the IP is off a network interface that is part of the analysis machine network or
# route/forward traffic between the analysis machines and the resultserver.
resultserver:
  listen_ip: 192.168.30.1
  listen_port: 2042

# Settings used by Cuckoo to find the tcpdump binary to use for network capture of machine traffic.
tcpdump:
  enabled: True
  path: /usr/bin/tcpdump

# Automatic per-task network routing. Before a task runs, the rooter
# is asked to apply a submitted or default network route. Cuckoo rooter
# must be running and its unix socket path must be configured here.
network_routing:
  enabled: False
  # Cuckoo rooter socket path. Must be writable and readable for the user
  # that runs Cuckoo.
  rooter_socket: null

platform:
  # Use the machine tags determined during the identification phase for machine selection.
  # Enabling this means your analyis machines have been configured with the tags
  # listed in conf/processing/identification.yaml
  autotag: False

state_control:
  # Cancel an analysis if the submitted file was not identified during the
  # identification stage.
  cancel_unidentified: False

processing:
  # Processing workers are the dedicated processes that perform the processing
  # of submitted target and collected data.
  worker_amount:
    # Identification is responsible for unpacking and identifying a submitted target.
    identification: 1
    # Pre workers are responsible for all pre-processing and more extensive static analysis.
    # that is performed before tasks are created.
    pre: 1
    # Post workers are responsible for the processing of data collected during each task.
    post: 1

# The Cuckoo 'long term storage' host that reported analyses should be moved to when
# starting 'cuckoocleanup remotestorage'. This host must have an import controller
# instance and the Cuckoo API running.
remote_storage:
  # The API url of a remote running Cuckoo API.
  api_url: null

  # API key needs to have administrator privileges to export to
  # a remote Cuckoo.
  api_key: null

# Settings used by Cuckoo submit
submit:
  # min_file_size for submit
  min_file_size: 133

  # max_file_size for submit, default 4gb
```
</br>

### analysissettings.yaml
Location: `conf/analysissettings.yaml`

It contains submission settings limits and defaults.

```yaml
# Limits on settings. Submissions will be denied if they exceed any
# of these limits.
limits:
  max_timeout: 300
  max_priority: 999
  # The maximum amount of platforms a submission can have.
  max_platforms: 3

# The default settings that will be used if these are not given.
default:
  # The timeout in seconds that will be used for each task.
  timeout: 120
  # The priority that will be used when in scheduling. A higher number
  # means a higher priority.
  priority: 1
  # The route that will be used for each task. Automatic network routing
  # must be enabled and rooter must be running for this feature to work.
  # See cuckoo.yaml.
  route:
    # The route type: internet, vpn, or drop.
    type: null
    # Route options such as 'country: somecountry' for a VPN route.
    options:

# Settings used to determine the platform to use if no platforms
# are provided on submission.
platform:
  # The OS versions of a platform that should be added to settings for an
  # identified platform. These versions are also used for the multi_platform
  # and fallback_platforms settings. Multiple versions will result in a
  # task for each version. Each platform must at least have a list of 1 version.
  versions:
    windows:
    - 10

  # Which of the supported platforms determined during the identification stage
  # should actually be used if a target can run on multiple platforms.
  # This should be a list of platform names.
  # The OS versions used are the ones specified in the 'versions' setting.
  multi_platform:
  - windows

  # Which platform(s) should be used if no platforms the target can run on were
  # identified and no platforms were provided on submission?
  # This should be a list of platform names.
  # The OS versions used are the ones specified in the 'versions' setting.
  fallback_platforms:
  - windows
```

### qemu.yaml
Location: `conf/machineries/qemu.yaml`

This configuration handles QEMU virtual machines for Cuckoo.

- `interface` - this needs to match the interface that was created using `vmcloak-qemubridge` in [Configuring VMCloak](../installing/vmcloak.md#configuring-vmcloak){:target=_blank}

```yaml
# Specify the name of the network interface/bridge that is the default gateway
# for the QEMU machines.

### routing.yaml

Location: `conf/node/routing.yaml`
This configuration contains all settings used by Cuckoo rooter such as:

- Outgoing interfaces and a routing table for internet routing.
- Existing VPN interfaces and routing tables for VPN routing.
- OpenVPN configuration files and up script paths for automatically starting VPNs.

Cuckoo rooter automatically applies per-task network routes and settings.

```yaml
# This is the configuration file for Cuckoo rooter. Rooter performs
# automatic routing for analysis machines. This file contains the
# routes that will be available to each Cuckoo node. Cuckoo rooter must be
# running for these routes to work.

# Internet/dirty line routing routes machine traffic directly over the
# specified interface. The machine IP will be added to the specified
# routing table. Note that this will route the malicious traffic over the
# configured network. An example of internet route could be a preconfigured
# VPN interface and routing table.
internet:
  # Enable or disable internet routing.
  enabled: False
  # The interface the network should be forwarded to to reach the internet.
  interface: null
  # The routing table id/name rooter should add machine IPs to. This table
  # should have the routes that result in traffic being routed over the
  # specified interface.
  routing_table: main

# Rooter can use preconfigured VPN interfaces and routing tables and can also
# start OpenVPN VPNs if their configuration paths are specified. VPN
# routing is used when a country is specified as a routing option.

# available VPN that matches the specified country or the first available
# VPN if no country is specified.
